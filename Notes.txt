Ubuntu Linux Setup Notes:

Why Linux?

  If you are a windows user, I highly recommend you set up the delveoping environment using VM, (for example, VirtualBox + Ubuntu), because ruby on rails is simple not optmized for windows, sooner or later you will encounter gem / dependencies related bugs that you cannot fix, to save yourself from this kind of trouble, it is better to simple switch to Linux or Mac.

Follow the step-by-step installation guide here:

TERIMINAL SETUP

    Color the prompt:
    
  1. subl ~/.bashrc
  2. force_color_prompt=yes

SUBLIME SETUP

  1. bottom right corner: Indent using space, tab width: 2

GIT SETUP

  Don't use ssh!

  #If you clone GitHub repositories using SSH, then you authenticate using SSH keys instead of a username and password. For help setting up an SSH connection, see Generating SSH Keys.

  #1. $ git config --global credential.helper cache
  # Set git to use the credential memory cache

  #2. $ git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
  # Set the cache to timeout after 1 hour (setting is in seconds)

  #3. to permanently store git credential, use the following command:

  git config --global credential.helper store


  **Simply by adding remote brach to local git: **
  
  $git remote add origin https://github.com/yuyueugene84/my-notes.git
  $git push origin master

  And git should ask you for username and password, just set them up and you should be able to push to github with https instead of SSH

  Of course, you don't want to enter username and password everytime you push to remote repository, so:

  git config --global credential.helper cache

  this command will cache your github credential 

  git config --global credential.helper store

  this will store your git credential permanently

Once you're done creating a new rails app, make sure you:

  1. bundle install
    1.1 If the bundle install fails, and error message says:
      bundle command not listed, then do 

      gem install bundler

    1.2 Some projects will use rmagick gem, which requires imagemagick library, make sure you install it:

      Mac:
        brew install imagemagick

      Linux:
        sudo apt-get install imagemagick
