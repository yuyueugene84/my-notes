Ubuntu Linux Setup Notes:

  If you are a windows user, I highly recommend you set up the delveoping environment using VM, (for example, VirtualBox + Ubuntu), because ruby on rails is simple not optmized for windows, sooner or later you will encounter gem / dependencies related bugs that you cannot fix.

Follow the step-by-step installation guide here:

TERIMINAL SETUP

    Color the prompt:
    
  1. subl ~/.bashrc
  2, force_color_prompt=yes

SUBLIME SETUP

  1. bottom right corner: Indent using space, tab width: 2

GIT SETUP

  Don't use ssh!

  #If you clone GitHub repositories using SSH, then you authenticate using SSH keys instead of a username and password. For help setting up an SSH connection, see Generating SSH Keys.

  #1. $ git config --global credential.helper cache
  # Set git to use the credential memory cache

  #2. $ git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
  # Set the cache to timeout after 1 hour (setting is in seconds)

  **Simply by adding remote brach to local git: **
  
  $git remote add origin https://github.com/yuyueugene84/my-notes.git
  $git push origin master

  And git should ask you for username and password, just set them up and you should be able to push to github with https instead of SSH
